Testing description:
	We opted to test our code using both unit testing and testing with a representative sample of final output combinations (dubbed "quadrant testing"). We created separate test classes for each type of testing, and used JUnit in Eclipse for each. The driverTest file was used for unit testing, ensuring that each portion of the control flow was tested.
	For "quadrant testing" we designed a set of test cases that serves as a respresentative sample of possible outputs (https://github.com/TeamFisher-ICS414/VOR/Testing plan.xlsx). There were 17 test cases in total for this portion. All tests were successful.
